## Introduction

Text summarization is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves creating a concise and accurate summary of a longer text. This project uses a transformer-based model, `facebook/bart-large-cnn`, to perform text summarization on the `Samsung/samsum` dataset.

## Dataset

The `Samsung/samsum` dataset contains dialogues and their corresponding summaries, making it suitable for training and evaluating text summarization models.

## Model

The model used is `facebook/bart-large-cnn`, a pre-trained transformer model specifically designed for text generation tasks, including summarization.

## Results

The model achieves high performance on the test set, as evaluated by the ROUGE metric.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets rouge_score
